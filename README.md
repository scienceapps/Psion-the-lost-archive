A Python-based toolset for extracting URLs from legacy .txt and .zip files, and downloading their archived versions from the Wayback Machine, for recovering Psion Epoc / Sibo software from old CD-ROMs

## Features : 

- Scans directories for .txt files and .zip archives containing text.
- Extracts all valid URLs using regular expressions.
- Downloads archived versions of URLs from the Wayback Machine (1997â€“2005).
- Cleans and formats URLs for compatibility with wayback_machine_downloader.
- Organizes downloads by domain and timestamp.

## Extract URLs from legacy files
`python 01-extract_urls.py`
This will scan the specified directory and output a list of URLs to a .txt file.

`palmtops_url.txt` sample file is generated by placing all the Team Palmtops magazine CD-ROMs unpacked ISO files from issues 01 to 36 in the input directory. https://archive.org/search?query=team+palmtops
